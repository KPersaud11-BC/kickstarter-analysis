# Kickstarting with Excel by Kieran Persaud

## Overview of Project

Louise is a playwright who endeavored to start a crowdfunding campaign to fund her play, *Fever*. She had a budget of over $10,000 and sought advice about how to successfully set up and execute her campaign. She came close to reaching her fundraising goal, and is now seeking advice about how different campaigns performed in relation to their launch date and fundraising goals.

To do this, I analyzed data from various Kickstarter campaigns to determine if there are any trends in start times, fundraising goals, or other factors that can be implemented in Louise’s project.

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to determine if there are any trends in start times, fundraising goals, or other factors that can be implemented in Louise’s project.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
